Flood mapping with Google Earth Engine, with satellite image sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 (for RGB).

__Area of study__</br>
The area of study is near Abbortsford, BC, Canada.

__Event of study__</br>
In mid-Nov 2021, atmospheric river brought heavy rainfall to southern BC, Canada.
In Hope, British Columbia, 277.5 millimetres (10.93 in) of rain fell from November 14 to 15, 2021, nearing the two-day record of 303.6 millimetres (11.95 in) set from November 9 to 10 1990.
